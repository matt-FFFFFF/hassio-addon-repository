# Home Assistant PostgreSQL addon

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

This addon is part of [my Home Assistant addon repo](https://github.com/matt-FFFFFF/hassio-addon-repository) - see link for instructions on how to add to Home Assistant.

## Version

This addon uses version 12.5 of PostgreSQL.
It is based on the official Docker Hub build on [Github](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/tree/master/12/alpine).
This image uses the Home Assistant base image, rather than the native Alpine image used in the official image.

## Configuration

Set the database name, username and password in the `Configuration` tab of the addon before starting it for the first time:

```yml
username: username
password: password
database: databasename
```

## Connecting to the DB

To connect your application to the database, specify the server name as: `29b65938-postgres` (this is correct if you have installed it from [my addon repo](https://github.com/matt-FFFFFF/hassio-addon-repository)). The port number is the default of 5432.
